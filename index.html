              Millions of companion animals in shelters across America are just
              waiting for a special home like yours. Navigating the adoption
              process isn't as hard as you think. We can help you find the
              perfect pet and discover how amazing adopting a pet can be.
              <br />
              <br />
              An animal shelter or a rescue group is the best source for a new
              pet, and our pet-care experts have compiled all the information
              you'll need to find your nearest group, select a pet who matches
              your lifestyle, and more.
